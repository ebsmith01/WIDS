# Reproducible Research
The point of making research reproducible is to make it easier to re-create  and identify exactly what you did and why it was done.

Using Rmarkdown as a tool helps with this by consolidating the all aspects of a data science project into one file.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(recipes)
head(mtcars)
```

# Tidyverse

## dplyr helps with making code more explicit and easily understandable by using the pipe operator ('%>%')
### Functions such as select and filter are easy to use and understand 
### Joins are also easier using the tidyverse

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  filter(cyl == 6)

mtcars[1:3]

mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg,cyl,disp)


mtcars %>% 
  arrange(cyl,disp,mpg)

 
mtcars$disp

mtcars %>% 
  select(disp)
```
### This example shows the base R versus the tidyverse alternative and what the look like side by side.

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  inner_join(mtcars, by= 'wt', suffix= c('.x','.y'))

```

# Tidymodels
## The modeling ecosystem in the tidyverse made up of 8 packages designed to handle different parts of a modeling project.
## parsnip, recipes and workflows take care of the preprocessing and provide a way to link a model to it's preprocessing. 
### Note: in the example below, I only use steps needed for this specific example, but there are many more steps that I didn't use in this example and they can all be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/recipes/recipes.pdf
### Setting the seed enables the analysis to be reproducible when random numbers are used

```{r}
set.seed(555)
# Put 3/4 of the data into the training set 
data_split <- initial_split(iris, prop = 3/4)

# Create data frames for the two sets:
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data  <- testing(data_split)


recipes_ex <- 
  recipe(Species~ ., data = train_data) %>%
  step_rm(Species) %>% prep(training = train_data)
#estimates the required parameters from a training set to apply late

bake(recipes_ex,test_data)
 #applies recipes to new data 

lm_mod <- 
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")

example_wflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lm_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(recipes_ex)

#example_fit <- fit(example_wflow, data = train_data)
```


# Git

### Open source version control system
### Keeps track of changes
### Keep all users working on a project using the most recent version

`git init <directory>`

## Create empty Git repo in specified directory

`git status`

## List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked

`git add`

## Stage all changes in for the next commit

`git commit -m "<message>"`

## Commit the staged snapshot.

`git push` 

## Push the changes to the current branch 

`git pull` 

## Fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content
